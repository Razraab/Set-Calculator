<h1>Numeric set calculator</h1>

>> I didn't really like statistics class in school, 

In numerical sets with a lot of numbers it is difficult to find all these medians, modes, variance especially very difficult when there are a lot of numbers. To solve the problem I made an application on .Net Core WPF with calculations of all the numbers I needed. 

I did the project a long time ago, and decided to post it now, so don't be surprised by its interface.
